## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Git

## Installation

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install the required dependencies (`npm install`)


## Start the development server:
### `npm start`

## Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

# Additional Features
## Testing

This project uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing and simple test was implemented. Cypress is a modern end-to-end testing framework for web applications.

## Approach

- I started by doing an analysis on the given tasks and I did a project planning for each page, navbars, buttons and logics.
- I took research and did wireframes on how a shopping cart works and what all need to be included for a basic shopping cart on an ecommerce site
- The project was started with a base template and layouts of main sections.
- I chose to go with a simple and responsive UI design, not making it too complicated.
- Every logic and functions were implemented and tested.
- Bugs and errors were found and Changes were made on designs and functionality.

### further improvements like search bar to render list or to find a specific product, trimming the javascript bundles and using `Lazy loading images` could improve the performance of the app.
